# React Full Stack

My Personal implementation for React Boilerplate

## Dev

`npm run dev`

- Dev Server - [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
- Nodemon Server - [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:900)

## Build

`npm run build`

Creates a simple express server that puts all your files into `localhost:9000`

## Tech

This dev build contains the following:

**Front-End**

- React
- styled-components

**Back-End**

- Express

## Build Process

I believe creating your own boilerplate a necessity to understanding what you're actually building. You don't have to go too indepth to realize how/why certain tech has been added and what I wanted to achieve with this build.
