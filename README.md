# React Full Stack

My Personal implementation for React Boilerplate

## Dev

`npm run dev`

- Dev Server - [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
- Nodemon Server - [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:900)

## Build

`npm run build`

Creates a simple express server that puts all your files into `localhost:9000`

## Tech

This dev build contains the following:

**Front-End**

- React
- styled-components

**Back-End**

- Express

## Build Process

I believe creating your own boilerplate a necessity to understanding what you're actually building. You don't have to go too indepth to realize how/why certain tech has been added and what I wanted to achieve with this build.

### Webpack

- A straight forward two round systems that gives us a Development server and a Production server. We merge them together using a `common.js` file that way we have the same processes use the same modules and configs.

### Styled Components

- Although I had heard of `styled-components` since 2017(?) I didn't really start seeing actual results until recently. In that time I was able to see the true power of it. In my company we use a variety of styling systems, but `styled-components` has allowed us to develop faster. This could always change for a better system mostly anything that will allow us to get faster in developing.

### Express

- I am truthful to myself to say that I have no recent experience with backend development. So this is part of my learning experience. I've concentrated straight with the fact that some of my ideas haven't had the need for a backend because they were mostly done in memory.
- This has more recently changed by the fact that I'm learning more about data visualizations. So this is an excellent way to start learning.

## Future

- This boilerplate exemplifies my current knowledgebase. I'd be lying to say that I know everything. I'm sure that there are better developers out there who know more than me or develop in a much more "safe" environment. But honestly this is all about the learning process. We should always be learning.

### TypeScript

- I want to explore the idea of having typeScript dictate how we communicate with the backend. I don't know if this would lend itself to creating a better environment but rather a "safe" environment.
- I don't have enough technical knowledge to decide _how_ fast this would make my env. I would rather keep it within my own knowledge realm.
